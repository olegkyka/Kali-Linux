Description: A simple VoIP corporate directory enumeration tool
 ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful 
 VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior 
 of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries 
 that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the 
 same way that the "corporate directory" feature of VoIP hardphones 
 enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE 
 was developed as a research idea born from "VoIP Hopper" to 
 automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an 
 enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks 
 will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than 
 targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP 
 addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to 
 download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the 
 directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other 
 VoIP assessment tools.
